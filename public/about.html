<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a passionate computer science student with a keen interest in coding and problem-solving. During my educational journey, I had the incredible opportunity to intern at American Express, where I gained valuable real-world experience in the field. Beyond the digital realm, I find joy in the analog world as well â€“ I'm an avid baker, finding delight in creating delicious treats.</p>

<p> When I'm not in front of a screen or in the kitchen, you'll often find me engrossed in a good book or lost in the melodies of music, particularly those of Taylor Swift, a personal favorite. I have an insatiable wanderlust, always seeking new adventures and places to explore, and I can never resist the allure of a captivating movie. My diverse interests reflect my curiosity and zest for life's myriad experiences.</p>
